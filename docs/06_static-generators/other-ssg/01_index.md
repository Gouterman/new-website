title: Integrating with other static generators
---

All the websites built with a static website generator are made of:

* Static files which represent the actual content of the pages (usually written in Markdown + [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), YAML, JSON or Toml);
* Some HTML templates that use these files to generate the actual static HTML pages you will upload online.

With DatoCMS here's the workflow:

1. You create a web administrative interface for your editors that fits exactly the needs of your static website;
2. Editors can make changes to the content of the website from that CMS interface you prepared;
3. Using our CLI tool, all the data stored in your DatoCMS administrative interface can be transformed into local Markdown/YAML/JSON/Toml files, so that can be "digested" by the static website generator just as they were written by hand.

The process of translating the data coming from the API into static files can be performed both on your machine during the development process of the website, and in your Continuous Deployment service anytime the editors request a new build pressing a *Publish changes* button on the web interface.

Now your static website isn't static anymore! Isn't this awesome?! :-)

Our Javascript-based CLI tool makes it extremely convenient to transform the content stored in your administrative area into local files. You are in charge of specifing how DatoCMS records will be dumped into local files using a Javascript config file called `dato.config.js`.

Once you've dumped your remote content into local files, you can keep on work on your static website like you're used to.

### Installation

Once you have a working NodeJS environment in your machine, inside your website project you can install the `datocms-client` package by running these commands:

```bash
$ npm init
$ npm install datocms-client --save-dev
```

If everything worked correctly, you should now run `dato` and see something like this:

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/dato
Usage:
  dato dump [--token=<apiToken>] [--config=<file>]
  dato -h | --help
  dato --version
```

The main command the `dato` CLI tool exposes is `dump`, which is the one you're going to use to fetch the records from our API and transform them into local files.

You can invoke the command like this:

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/dato dump --token=READONLY_API_TOKEN
```

You can find your API token in the *Admin area > API tokens* section:

![foo](../../images/api-token.png)

#### Passing the API token as environment variable

Instead of specifying the API token as a parameter, you can pass it as an environment variable:

```bash
$ export DATO_API_TOKEN=abc123
$ ./node_modules/.bin/dato dump
```

The CLI tool also loads environment variables from a `.env` file, so you can place the token there and forget about it (just make sure not to publish your `.env` file on Github):

```bash
$ echo '.env' >> .gitignore
$ echo 'DATO_API_TOKEN=abc123' >> .env
$ ./node_modules/.bin/dato dump
```

---

#### Published vs latest versions

If you are working on development/staging environment, you might want to preview the latest version of records instead of the published one. In this case, you can add a `--preview` flag:

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/dato dump --preview
```

---

### The config file

The `dump` command will read a file `dato.config.js` (or the file passed by the `--config` option). This file should contain instructions to transform the content stored remotely in DatoCMS into local files.

Inside this file, you need to export a function that takes three arguments:

* The first argument, `dato`, allows you to get content coming from your administrative area;
* The second argument, `root`, represents the root of your project and makes it easy to create local files and directories;
* The third argument, `i18n`, is useful in multi-language sites to switch between the various available locales and get back translated content;

Let's watch a simple example to get started:

```javascript
// dato.config.js

module.exports = (dato, root, i18n) => {
  content = {
    hello: "world",
  };
  root.createDataFile("src/data/foobar.yml", "yaml", content)
};
```

Now run `dato dump`:

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/dato dump

âœ” Fetching content from DatoCMS...

* Written src/data/foobar.yml
```

Here, `root.createDataFile()` is a method that generates YAML/TOML/JSON files. Inside Metalsmith, you can then read this file with ie. [metalsmith-metadata](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-metadata).

You can also generate Markdown posts with the `root.createPost()` method:

```javascript
// dato.config.js

module.exports = (dato, root, i18n) => {
  root.createPost(
    "src/articles/first-article.md", "yaml", {
      frontmatter: { 
        title: "First article", 
      },
      content: "Lorem **ipsum dolor sit amet**, consectetur adipiscing elit."
    }
  );
};
```

If you need to place a collection of posts within a folder, you can use the `root.directory` method, so that every time the `dump` command is executed, **previous content of the directory will be erased**:

```javascript
// dato.config.js

module.exports = (dato, root, i18n) => {

  // inside a "src/articles" directory...
  root.directory("src/articles", (articlesDir) => {

    // ...let's write 10 markdown articles, complete with frontmatter
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

      articlesDir.createPost(
        `article-${i}.md`, "yaml", {
          frontmatter: { 
            title: `Article ${i}`, 
          },
          content: "Lorem **ipsum dolor sit amet**, consectetur adipiscing elit."
        }
      );
    }
  });
};
```

Now that you know how you can create local files, the final step is to start generating them with data coming from DatoCMS. The first argument called `dato` is available exactly for this purpose:

```javascript
// dato.config.js

module.exports = (dato, root, i18n) => {

  // inside a "src/articles" directory...
  root.directory("src/articles", (articlesDir) => {

    // ...iterate over the "Blog post" records...
    dato.blogPosts.forEach((article) => {

      // ...and create a markdown file for each article!
      articlesDir.createPost(
        `${article.slug}.md`, "yaml", {
          frontmatter: { 
            title: article.title, 
          },
          content: article.content
        }
      );
    });
  });
};
```

Once your `dato.config.js` is ready, just run the `dato dump` command: you should see your  project folder populated with new files.

Obviously, that's just a quick tour: you can learn all the details about how to access your records inside your config file in the following sections.
